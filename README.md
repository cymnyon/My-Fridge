# My Fridge
Welcome to **My Fridge**, a web application designed to help you store and organize your sticky notes, diaries, name cards, and any other images with text in a convenient and private space. Just like a fridge keeps things fresh and preserves them for a long time, My Fridge allows you to preserve your important memories and interests.

## About the App
**My Fridge** is inspired by the concept of a refrigerator where we store things that we want to keep fresh and have access to whenever we need them. Similarly, this app enables you to keep track of your interests and memories over time.
